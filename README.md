# Site Recreation

Pick any site that you want and recreate the landing (i.e home page) of the site.

Some considerations for this lab:

You will need to create you HTML and CSS pages to begin the lab.

Your main concern should be recreating the look of the website.  You do not need to worry about making components work on the site.  This is strictly a static page intended to sharpen your front-end skills.  We will get to functionality very soon!

Remember to follow these guidelines for submitting your work when you are finished.
