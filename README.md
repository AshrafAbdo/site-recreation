**Objective:** Pick any site that you want and re-create the landing page (i.e. homepage) of the site using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo, and clone it into your `develop` folder on your local machine.

2. Choose a site, and start by drawing a simple wireframe of its layout.

3. Your focus should be on re-creating the layout of the website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. You should leverage Bootstrap's grid system and componenets. *Don't worry about very specific design elements or making interactive components work on the site.* This is strictly a static page intended to sharpen your front-end skills. We will get to functionality very soon!

## Examples

Feel free to choose one of these example sites to replicate:

* <a href="http://www.brewerydb.com" target="_blank">Brewery DB</a>
* <a href="http://resourceguruapp.com" target="_blank">Resource Guru</a>
* <a href="http://trekcxccup.com" target="_blank">Trek Cup</a>

## Submission

* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
* Once you've finished the assignment and pushed your work to GitHub, make a pull request from your fork to the original repo.
